# How we work... #

As en employee, sometimes it's hard to know what's expected of you in terms of commitment and communication. This is especially troublesome in a non-traditional environment such as a startup, where all processes and procedures are up for debate.

This document aims to provide a formalisation of those expectations.

We work:

## 1. Flexibly ##

Forcing employees into the 9-5 box is counter-productive. People have different schedules of productivity based on their lifestyle and personality type.

With that said we _do_ need some kind of time overlap so we can coordinate meetings and foster collaboration. We expect *8 hours* effective work per day, but your start and end time may vary within the following windows:

* Start between 8:00am - 10:30am
* End between 5:00pm - 7:30pm.
* A suggested 30 minute (minimum) lunch break, at the time of your chosing.

For example: the earlier riser will get into the coworking space at 8am, take a 1 hour lunch break through the day and finish at 5pm. The midnight coder might drop in to Slack just in time for the 10.30am standup, will take the same 1 hour lunch break through the day but will not finish work until 7:30pm.

## 2. With agility (little 'a') ##

The two hardest things in the software business are to deliver something people want, and to deliver it in a timely fashion. We belive the best way to counteract these challenges is to work with [agility](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html).

Notice we use the adjective and not the proper noun, "Agile", which typically refers to a set of processes and procedures pushed by $1000 per hour consultants.

Instead, we aim to work with agility by:

* Planning in short cycles.
* Delivering working software early and often.
* Using feedback (preferably backed by data) to drive the process.
* Applying the principles of continuous improvement to the *processes* of the team, not just the product.

## 3. Sustainably ##

Working in a start-up can be intense, but we see it as a two way street.

You're expected to go above and beyond when needed (e.g: when there's a project deadline or company emergency), but as a company we aspire to go above and beyond for you too (e.g: remote work, flexible hours, flexible vacation arrangements).

We work to sustain the _business_ and our _employees_.

## 4. Remotely ##

We believe remote work is the future. It provides flexibility and opportunities (travel, limited commuting time, more time with family) that are typically not possible in a traditional office setting.

## 5. Professionally ##

See the [engineering guidelines](engineering-guidelines.md) document for more informataion.

## 6. With Time off ##

Our leave policy is straightforward. You get 15 paid vacation days per year (in addition to any nationally observed holidays). You can carry a maximum of 5 days leave forward per year. We ordinarily require 1 week notice if you want to take time off. If you're requesting 5 or more days leave, we require 4 weeks notice.
