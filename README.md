# Foodkit Engineering Team Handbook #

Welcome to the Foodkit Engineering Team Handbook! The purpose of this document is twofold.

The first is to provide a reference for new and existing employees so they know what's expected of them, and what they should expect from their colleagues.

The second is to give potential future employees an honest and accurate window into our working style. If this sounds like the kind of environment you'd like to work in, we'd love to [hear from you](mailto:hello@ginja.co.th)!
