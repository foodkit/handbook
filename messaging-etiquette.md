# Messaging Etiquette #

The office environment has changed _drastically_ in the past couple of decades. New tools, the commodification of videotelephony, and changes in the industry's understanding of workplace psychology

mean that while the workplace is a dynamic and evolving place
our work _culture_ is still catching up. We need new rules and social norms for a new kind of workplace.

## Messaging ##

We use [Slack](https://slack.com) for work-related company-internal text messaging. While real-time Internet-based chat has been around for decades, it's only recently fallen into common usage in professional settings. It represents a new paradigm in workplace communication, and with this paradigm shift comes the need for an appropriate set of behavioural guidelines and social norms.

These rules are still being written (by us _and_ the rest of the Internet, no one has it worked out yet!) but there are some general points of etiquette that we should follow and expect from others.

### Be nice ###

This is a good rule wherever you are. It's easy to infer tone in Slack, but if a person says something that sounds off, give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they meant well.

If there is someone who isn't behaving well or makes you uncomfortable, be honest with them (if you can). If you are uncomfortable doing that or feel the person isn't being receptive, direct message your manager (or another member of management)

### Be respectful ###

Be respectful to those of all genders, sexes, races, sexual orientations, religions... You get the picture.

Be mindful in what you post: what may seem innocuous to you could be offensive to someone else. If you ever have a question about whether you should post something, don't do it!

Just because it's Slack doesn't mean normal office appropriate behaviour isn't expected. Don't write anything in a message you wouldn't feel comfortable saying aloud.

### Easy on the giphys ###

We get it, giphy is hilarious. Some of the most memorable Slack moments happen when giphy nails it (or completely misses the mark). But giphy's messages are also very distracting and due to their size can quickly push the conversation off the screen. You don't want your coworker to miss an important piece of information because it was obscured by an animated gif of [James Van Der Beek crying](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oz8xUK8V7suY7W9SE/giphy.gif).

Please keep the giphys under control, and (ideally) constrainted to the \#random channel and/or direct messages.

### Take it outside of Slack ###

If you find yourself going back and forth with a fellow employee more than a few times, walk over to their desk or give them a [call](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/216771908-Make-calls-in-Slack). Slack is great for short, non-collaborative conversations, not so great for others.

### ASAP? ###

If something truly is urgent, use a communication method appropriate to the level of urgency.

Either go and talk with your colleague face-to-face or call them. If you wouldn't pick up your mobile phone and physically dial the person to talk about it, it probably isn't _really_ urgent.
